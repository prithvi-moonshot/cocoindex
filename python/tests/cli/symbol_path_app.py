"""Test app whose stable paths mix symbol and string keys.

`mount_each` auto-derives its subpath from the function name, so each item
lands at `/@process_files/"<name>"` — the shape `cocoindex show` has to
round-trip through its `STABLE_PATH` argument. One item name contains a `/`,
which only stays a single path part because string keys are quoted.
